This is a PHP wrapper for the OLE/COM interface provided by PlanePlotter

More information available here:

http://www.coaa.co.uk/planeplotter.htm
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/planeplotter/

The OLE/COM interface is documented in the help files in the application.

After downloading, you'll want to make a file called pp-config-local.php
which overrides the value of $PPdir if your logs are located elsewhere.

A simple utility pp-dump.php is provided.
